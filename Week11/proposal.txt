Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Password Manager and Creator / programa de guardar y crear contrase√±as
2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
The creation of stong passwords that people can use to keep their files safe.
3. What will you learn from developing this program? 
I will learn how to iterate through lists of symobls, letters, and numbers to complete a string of varying length 
and I will learn how to save that string into a csv file.
4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
csv, random, datetime, string 
5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
YES
6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
YES
